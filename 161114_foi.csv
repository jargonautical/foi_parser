Appeal by local authority concerning whether a child can be regarded as 'likely to suffer' harm for the purposes of s 31(2) of the Children Act 1989 if another child has been harmed in the past and there is a possibility that the parent now caring for him or her was responsible for the harm to the other child. The Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal. Lady Hale gives the main judgment, Lord Wilson and Lord Sumption disagreeing on one point. Section 31 (2) of the Children Act 1989 imposes a threshold which must be satisfied before a care or supervision order can be made in respect of a child. First the child must have suffered or be likely to suffer significant harm; secondly, that harm must be attributable to the care given or likely to be given to the child. If the threshold is crossed then the court will treat the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration when deciding whether to make an order. The issue in this case is whether a child can be regarded as 'likely to suffer' harm if another child has been harmed in the past and there is a possibility that the parent now caring for him or her was responsible for the harm to the other child. The local authority in this case brought care proceedings in respect of three children who are cared for by DJ and JJ. The two oldest are the children of DJ and his former partner, and have always lived with DJ. The youngest child is JJ's daughter, her third child with her former partner, SW. The local authority submitted that the three children were likely to suffer significant harm because JJ's first child with SW, T-J, had died of non-accidental injuries in 2004. In earlier care proceedings relating to JJ and SW's second child, who was subsequently adopted, a judge had found that either JJ or SW had caused the injuries to T-J and the other had at the very least colluded to hide the truth. In the present proceedings the local authority sought to rely solely on the finding that JJ was a possible perpetrator of the injuries to T-J. It submitted that this was a finding of fact sufficient as a matter of law to satisfy the s 31(2) threshold in respect of the three children now c ared for by JJ and DJ. The High Court held on a preliminary issue that likelihood of significant harm can only be established by reference to past facts that are proved on the balance of probabilities. Mere possibility was insufficient. The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the local authority but granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the local authority's appeal. The main judgment is given by Lady Hale, with whom all the justices agree. Lord Wilson expresses disagreement on one point, which Lord Sumption shares. Lord Reed gives an additional judgment, with which Lord Clarke and Lord Carnwath agree. Lord Hope agrees with Lady Hale and Lord Reed. It is a serious matter for the state compulsorily to remove a child from his family of birth. The section 31(2) threshold is an important",Information not held,05/02/2015,,,12/02/2015,Freedom of Information Act,,

Having done some additional research on this change I have discovered all councils have been asked to make savings around their road safety spending. The decision as to which schools lose their support seems to be based on the traffic levels on the road as well as the existence of other crossings nearby. As the traffic levels outside Bassetts Farm Primary School are extremely busy and there are no other crossing points on St Johns Rd I am confused as to why it is losing its crossing patrol. With this in mind I would like the following information. A breakdown of all the current patrolled crossings in Exmouth with details of which are soon to be removed. Alongside each listed patrol I would like to see details of the traffic levels on that road and on what date and time these traffic levels were recorded.

Since they are considerably disadvantaged in this way, this is likely to be an important health inequality in your local population. It is therefore very important that the authority and the Health & Wellbeing Board assess the extent and nature of the problem, and agree plans to address those needs and thereby to reduce the inequalities. I would, therefore, be grateful to receive information about the authority and its associated Health and Wellbeing Board's assessment of the problem; the local needs and barriers; and plans to tackle any associated inequalities. Specifically: 1.	Kindly identify any estimates used by the authority and/or its associated HWBs of the numbers of people in your local population who have impairments/disabilities and the types of such impairments. Kindly let me have copies of the relevant reports. It would also be very helpful if you could identify any section in your Joint Strategic Needs Assessment where these are detailed. 2.	Please identify any assessments of the health and wellbeing needs of people with impairments/disabilities in your local population, and the barriers they face in having their needs met. Please note that I do not refer to individual client needs, but rather those of groups (or ""populations"") of people with impairments - for example, people in your local population who are blind, or those with very limited movement. I would be very grateful if any sections focusing on their social and sexual needs relating to health and wellbeing could be identified. If a relevant epidemiological needs assessment has been carried out, that would be especially useful. 3.	Please state whether the authority, and its associated HWBs, have already agreed or scheduled any plans to address the health and wellbeing needs of people with impairments/disabilities specifically related to their social and sexual relationship needs, and if so, kindly let me have copies. In order to assist you with this request, my query has been outlined as specifically as possible. If however this request is too wide or too unclear, I would be grateful if you could contact me by email as I understand that under the act, you are required to advise and assist requesters. I also understand that, under the act, I should be entitled to a response within 20 working days. I would be grateful if you could confirm receipt of this request, and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future. You may specifically want to include Public Health and Adult Community Services departments in identifying the relevant documents. ",All information sent,20/03/2015,,,09/04/2015,Freedom of Information Act,,

3021896,25/05/2015,Planning Transportation and Environment,Low,Simon Osborne,20 MPH Research,"Thanks for your email, and apologies for the delay in getting back to you.As our primary interest is in the broader discussions over the introduction of 20mph limits (rather than specific streets), in terms of research and consultations then we are interested in the last 5 years or so. In terms of understanding the current situation, we are really after a snapshot of what is happening now (or as recently as is reasonable). I hope that helps clarify your request, if you have any further questions please do get in touch. I am reachable on 01484 559909.ORIGINAL REQUEST We are making a request under the Freedom of Information Act.We are currently working on a major research project for Brake, the road safety charity, on 20mph limits. Our research is exploring the national case for 20mph limits, and we're looking to draw upon the experiences of local councils across the UK. Our primary interest is in sign-only and area-wide 20mph limits - that is, areas where the speed limit is 20mph through the use of signs-only, rather than physical traffic-calming measures such as chicanes and speedhumps.We will be synthesising this material, using qualitative and quantitative analysis, to develop a picture of the impact of these limits across the country. We hope that this research will inform the national debate and highlight good practice in improving road safety. We would emphasise that it is not our purpose to embarrass any individual councils for their policies or their implementation.We are requesting the following information:1. Electronic copies of any research, consultations, or analysis into 20mph limits that you have conducted. This includes: materials reviewing whether they should be introduced, consulting local stakeholders, or explaining their introduction; materials exploring the impact of 20mph limits in your area; and materials outlining reasons for not implementing 20mph limits, if this was decided.2. If your council has introduced any 20mph limits, on what proportion of roads have you done so, on a sign-only, area-wide or zone (traffic-calmed) basis? (Should you not have the precise lengths of roads that have been treated in this way, an estimate of the proportion of road types that have 20mph limits would still be useful, for example 20mph zones with traffic calming are in place around 90% of schools, and 20mph limits of some form are in place on around 50% of residential roads).3.What are your future plans for (a) the (further) development of 20mph limits and/or (b) consideration or review of whether to implement (more) 20mph limits?4.  a) For areas where you have introduced 20mph limits, what are your reasons for doing so? b) For areas where you have not introduced 20mph limits, what are your reasons for not doing so?5. Can you give us an idea of the costs of implementation of 20mph limits where you have done so? We would like to know the costs of i) research/consultations, ii) public engagement, iii) road signs (if possible broken down by the cost of new repeater signs, and replacement signs).",All information sent,26/05/2015,,,23/06/2015,Freedom of Information Act,,

It has been complemented by the more general public sector equality duty in the Equality Act 2010. The PSED (Public Sector Equality Duty) sets a particularly high bar with regard to authorities' duties to consider the impact of decisions on a range of people (and particularly those with protected characteristics). Recent caselaw interprets the PSED broadly, placing it front and centre with regard to any council plan to change the nature or form of services being delivered.The caselaw in two recent cases which engage directly with the PSED are Stuart Bracking and others v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions [2013] EWCA Civ 1345 and Aaron Hunt v North Somerset Council [2013] EWCA Civ 1483.  The latter case in particular makes it very clear that Members of Councils must fully understand and exercise their duties on the equalities implications of decisions, otherwise there is a real risk that they will be deemed unlawful. The judgment in the latter case also makes reference to the authority's failure to comply with the Education Act in its consultation on the withdrawal of certain youth services, which is a useful analogue for the 2007 ""duty to consult"" which, like the duty in the Education Act, predates the Equality Act but complements it in law.""",All information sent,26/06/2015,,,20/07/2015,Freedom of Information Act,,

What is the total number of secondary schools in your local authority area?2. How many of these are:a) RED.

In practice a RED school would have difficulty timetabling teaching to allow several wheelchair-users to receive a mainstream education.b) AMBER.  Partially wheelchair-accessible - a wheelchair user could follow a mainstream curriculum at the school, but a significant proportion of the site is upstairs and not accessible via a lift OR some main buildings do not have a disabled toilet OR one or more of the main entrances to your school has stepped access. In practice an AMBER school would have to undertake some rearrangement of the timetable to allow a wheelchair-user to receive a mainstream education AND/OR the child would have to take some circuitous routes around the site to reach teaching and recreational areas.c) GREEN. Fully wheelchair-accessible - all (or at least 90% of) teaching areas are accessible to wheelchair users, there are lifts to upper floors where applicable, and disabled toilets are provided in all main buildings.

4369896,17/02/2016,Highways Capital Development and Waste Management,High,Richard Kaye,Advisory Disabled Bay,"There is an Advisory disabled bay marked in the road outside of the property No 61 Elm grove. I am aware that this was previously granted to the occupiers of said address some time ago however, they never park in the bay because they have two garages with driveways for off-street parking a short distance from their premises. They always park their car in one of their garages mentioned. Parking in this road is difficult at the best of times. A Notice of Intent was placed, by DCC, on a lamp post outside number 61 Elm Grove in November after they reviewed the situation. The notice basically stated that it was understood that the disabled bay there was no longer needed and it was proposed to remove same.Shortly after this, several of the residents in Elm Grove, myself included, were made aware that the bay had been claimed by ""someone"". Since then, the occupiers No. 61 have actually made it known to acquaintances of theirs in Elm Grove it is in fact them, a husband and wife, who have claimed the bay. This has caused a certain amount of resentment by those endeavoring to park their cars in Elm Grove when space is limited.After looking through the D.C.C. Traffic Policy Note, DTP 03/09, it clearly states that the applicant for a disabled bay must be a blue badge holder and the vehicle in question is based at the applicants property. It also states that there must be a need for provision and no off-street parking available at or near (within 64 meters if it is the driver who is disabled) of the residence referred to. The occupiers of No. 61 own two garages with space for off-street parking nearby (about 50 meters distance) and they park their car every day in one of these garages. They never, apart from washing their car infrequently, park outside their premises in the disabled bay in question. I have never seen a disabled badge displayed in their car. Neither show obvious signs of a disability. In my opinion, and the opinion of other residents, a fraudulent application for a disabled parking bay may have been made by the occupiers of No. 61 because it is not needed as there is off street parking, owned by and always available to them, nearby. Everyone living here knows this and are extremely frustrated. As a result, because No. 61 never use ""their"" disabled bay, these three resultant actions occur......1/. Other residents in the road with whom the occupiers of No. 61 are friends with, park in ""their"" bay because it is never occupied by their vehicle. This occurs from time to time when parking becomes an issue in Elm Grove. 2/. A few other residents in Elm Grove are aware of and are very unhappy at the situation viz. the occupiers of No. 61 having a disabled bay when they a. Never use it and b. They have off-road parking available nearby. These residents park in the bay on occasions as a means of reprisal.3/. The bay in question however is mainly unused because the majority of people who live in this area will not park in a disabled bay as a matter of courtesy. Which is as it should be.I would also request that, as per your suggestion, this information  be passed to the relevant service as a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. That is to say in effect, how it has come about that the occupiers of 61 Elm Grove have been granted an Advisory Disabled Bay when it would very much seem they may not be entitled to same.",Vexatious request,22/02/2016,,"Booth, Meg",15/03/2016,Environmental Information Regulations,"Booth, Meg",

It is understood that this cable is bigger than required to serve a DSLAM cabinet at Ringmore.

I am extremely concerned of the damage that this water is doing to the foundations of my outbuildings and am a little concerned that there appears to be no interest in our report.

If any of the budget referred to in (a) is coming from the £22.75M allocated by BDUK to CDS for the Phase 2 SEP programme in January 2014, please detail the amount involved, when it has or will be called down from BDUK and if matched locally, the amount and source of local match funding involved. (c) If the value of vouchers issued, or verified orders taken by the scheme's suppliers exceeds the total budget referred to in (a), before March 2017, will the scheme be closed before March 2017 or will additional funding be provided? If additional funding will be provided please detail the sources and amounts anticipated. (d) In order to obtain a Broadband Voucher, applicants must submit their postcode and have it validated as eligible for a Broadband Voucher. Please detail how CDS have arrived at the list of postcodes that applicants postcodes are being validated against. Is the list of valid postcodes for the Broadband Voucher Scheme, the same as the postcodes shown in red on the CDS SEP Public Consultation webpage (http://www.connectingdevonandsomerset.co.uk/public-consultation/ ) and headed ""Map of Basic (2Mbps) Broadband Across CDS Programme Area""?

Should taxpayers assume that if they are able to obtain a voucher number through the CDS Broadband Voucher Scheme, that their postcode is NOT INCLUDED in the Phase 2 Intervention Area for which CDS expect to find NGA suppliers before the end of 2016? If this is not the case, and some postcodes for which CDS Broadband Vouchers are provided fall within the Phase 2 intervention area, will those vouchers become invalid once a Phase 2 supplier for those postcodes are contracted? If such vouchers are to remain valid after the Phase 2 supplier for the relevant postcode has been identified, how will CDS deal with the issue of overlapping State Aid in that postcode?",All information sent,28/04/2016,,,23/05/2016,Freedom of Information Act,,

The Act, as I understand it, allows for this: Section 11 allows me to express a preference for the format of the response and in this case it would be for the authority to complete the spreadsheet attached. Furthermore, although it isn't the letter of the law, the spirit of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 is that government should be responsive to the needs of data-analysts. I would also say that the information is limited to a narrow subject area and so the public body's records are likely to be held in a single location I would not imagine the request would take more than 18 hours to process.That said, I am happy to correspond with the parties to this request over email if there are particular parts that are more problematic than I would have hoped.",Some information sent and exceeds appropriate limit,29/04/2016,Other reason,,27/05/2016,Freedom of Information Act,,

Fairmile is a rural residential area, with very low levels of background noise at night.This evening at 10:55pm I was woken from sleep by the sound of heavy machinery and when I got dressed and went to investigate I found a WJ road surfacing lorry removing the recently painted dashed white lines in the centre of the road.There was no reason for this to be undertaken during night hours, as this road is not so heavily used that it could not be done during daylight hours (with appropriate traffic management).I was told by the contractors that had to reposition the white lines which had been painted in the wrong position. My assumption is that this was being done at this time of night simply for the convenience of the contractors who had to fit in  this unplanned work. This is not, IMO, a reason to disturb the sleep of local residents.I also refer you to the Department of Transport Traffic Advisory Leaflet 8/14 of November 2014 and BS 5228-1:2009 which point out the need for a formal assessment of the acceptable noise levels for residential areas and which needs to ""to have no significant increase over existing background levels"". (Since this is a rural residential area, background noise at night is very low level, so any noisy machinery would be a significant increase. In this case it was sufficient to wake me.) I request that you supply me with a copy of this assessment so that I can see what consideration you made for assuring that noise was acceptable..I look forward to your explanation.",All information sent,08/08/2016,,,17/08/2016,Environmental Information Regulations,,

In particular I am extremely concerned that not only is it unfair to pick on smaller libraries in principle, but the reality is that Braunton library serves over 13,000 people, just a few hundred less than some medium to large libraries, and is a much loved, lively and important part of our community with 1 in 5 people actively using it. My own background is that I am Senior Director of Global Campaigns for Save the Children and also Chair of the Trustees of Surfers Against Sewage. I have three children who go to school in Braunton and as a family we are extremely active users of the library. I understand that choices need to be made about how to manage budgets across Devon but I really do want the Council to understand that in the case of Braunton that a mistake has been made when proposing cuts which might ultimately close the Braunton library off the back of already significant cuts to opening hours which have already been made. As for the FOI request, my preference would be to receive documents by email to save on cost (and trees) and I would also like to be told of any potential cost before anything for which I might be charged is incurred. Please feel free to contact me if you need clarification. I look forward to hearing from you further.

IR1467164,07/07/2014,Services for Community,Low,Rebecca Eden,Bus Transport,"Thank you for your response. You anticipated that this would be disappointing and indeed it was and it really does not address my concerns. I appreciate budget restrictions but I also consider that far too little thought has been given to improving operational efficiency, the potential economic benefits to the community which could eventually feed some benefit of increased revenue to Devon County Council in the form of business taxes. I will now address your response and have again copied this to Shebbear Parish Council and Devon customer relations.With regards to the need to use double deck buses, your response has led me to ask further questions:1.	Please could you indicate the normal and maximum number of ticket holders that are travelling on its route from Shebbear to Stibb Cross, Stibb Cross to Great Torrington. These are points where there is a theoretical possibility of transfer to other services - e.g. Holsworthy and Bideford etc.2.	The normal comparative running cost (per km) and average annual maintenance costs of the  recent Scania N230UD (used on some routes)  the 2004 Dennis Trident/Alexander ALX400 often seen on the 71/72 routes and the most economical 23 seat Optare Solo Slim Line which are used on rural routes in many other parts of the country.3.	All buses have a limited economical life which is much dependent upon how much they are usedThe next paragraph of your response does not answer the question as to why a bus service cannot be provided to carry full-time workers to work. This would help to reduce the need for expensive road upgrading, such as the £2m works just completed at Roundswell, in order to possibly reduce peak hour congestion. From first impressions of the completed scheme, it would appear that the new roundabout is simply allowing the traffic to travel much faster on the roundabout itself with the potential for more serious accidents. The cost of this scheme was somewhat more than the £1.35m 'recent years' cuts you indicated. I understand that further upgradings such as this are being proposed for the A39/ A361 to deal with safety and congestion. Road upgrading projects such as this do little to improve the environment.  It would appear that the provision of bus services is little more than a response to social needs rather than economic and environmental needs. With regards to cuts in local bus subsidies, firstly this appears to be in contradiction with Central Government Policy https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/improving-local-transport/supporting-pages/increasing-the-use-of-busesI also refer you to the successful South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive - 'Better Bus Areas' scheme which I believe should be considered by all transport authorities. Secondly, I understand that the £1.35m cut since 2012 is a 20% reduction in the Bus Service Operator Grants. I also understand that this reduction will increase operator costs by just 1.5-2%. Would it not be possible to eliminate these costs by greater operating efficiency and providing services that would have a potentially greater use?With regards to the comment that you will 'continue to seek any alternative funding opportunities for bus services'. I would like to know what productive initiatives in this direction have been recently instigated. I am also very concerned that it would appear that local operatorsUnless I am much mistaken, I would suggest that DevonBus are simply managing the bus services in rural areas in such a way that it will not be long before many more services, including the 71 will cease to operate.",All information sent,10/07/2014,,,23/07/2014,Freedom of Information Act,,

I look to you to provide honest, straight forward replies to the queries below listed below.  1. What is the percentage area of Existing Woodland / vegetation that was outside of the RoMP and illegally stripped of trees and vegetation? Regarded as 'insignificant' by Stewart Redding . 2. Where is the top soil from the whole area being stored ( see attached photograph below indicating that unlike your claim, it is of relevance. I am now in possession of a sequence of photographs showing the topsoil that is according to you is LOST to crevices and is unrecoverable this and other photographs dispute your claim) (copied below) Please also refer to your monitoring report photographs dated 8 May 2012 indicating grown trees and vegetation in this area which cannot be sustained without a good topsoil organic availability. It was witnessed being 'bulldozed' over the edge of the work area.The information you provided is untrue and the pictures I hold and you supplied in your report are an indication of the economy of truth.When and who made the decision to make the claim that the topsoil was unrecoverable or was this claimed by the operator but unsubstantiated by DCC? 3. Please provide your investigation / results into the credential checks of the quarry operator.As the County monitoring officer surely you cannot claim it is not your responsibility or your authority to carry out these checks .I am asking this under the freedom of information act and that prior to allowing quarrying to commence that you had satisfied yourself of the directors/personnel's credentials to quarry and their certified geologist as is required under the H&S executive requirements . 4. By whom, when and where has the sound monitoring taken place about noise emanating from Whitecleaves quarry. I remind you of the Colin Bignall e-mail to your department and copied to Mike Deaton and Stewart Redding on 30 October 2008 and therefor request this information under the F.o.I Act. Again many many complaints have been made to your department or refered to T.D.C. over this period 2008 to date. I commend you to read this mail, it is damning evidence ! 5. Further to my above queries now that the decision has potentially been made about the very short term usage of Whitecleaves quarry can you now supply me with the information concerning the enforcement actions 'in toto' that was held in abeyance. FOIA section 30 no longer applies even if it might have done earlier.( This fact is open to legal debate ) and is of public interest .Particularly the unused cement hopper which is visually intrusive and I was assured would be removed in September 2013. A cement hopper cannot be seen as demolition equipment!!! Again this request is made under the F.o I. Act. I expect answers to my 5 reasonable requests including the accountable person who has allowed the abuse of this precious ecological site.I feel the previous answers you have supplied are untrue misleading and hold no one to account .Each person has their own speciality and I believe there has been manipulation of the truth to hide departmental inadequacies and shortcomings .",All information sent,05/08/2014,Staff absent or unavailable,,12/09/2014,Environmental Information Regulations,,

Upon checking why this was the case, it confirmed that the ticket issued wasonly for one hour.It is obvious that your machine is faulty and printed the wrong time.Because of this I am requesting the following under the Freedom of Information2000:I would like an engineers report confirming the date and time ofthe last service and recallibrationof machine 412I would like to see a printout of the said machine for 11040 of what coins it accepted /rejected (if any)I would like a copy of a current engineers report confirming that machine 412 isworking within the manufacturers specificationsI would like copies of any complaints received by the council regarding faulty ticketmachines in this area from people who have been wrongly accused of defaulting ontheir ticket.The fact that I purchased a ticket in the first place proves I had no intention of default,the ticket itself does not contain any terms or conditions by the ticket issuer, which, asit is a receipt for a financial transaction, it should do.The current government has expressed a desire that all unnecessary parking fines bequashed as (a) it does not represent a fair fee for non-compliance, (b) it affects tourismin a depressed economic time by antagonising the visitor into not returning in thefuture, (c) does not give the recipient a reasonable recourse to complain underTHREAT of doubling the charge.",All information sent,18/08/2014,,,01/09/2014,Freedom of Information Act,,

You indicated in your formal response that this might be possible 'at a later date' once the 'commercial confidentiality' phase of any ongoing discussions had passed. According to Press reports a week or more ago, the organisers (Sidmouth FolkWeek) no longer aim to try and use this new site in the next few years (if ever). Therefore there seems no remaining genuine reason for not disclosing a document that would shed light on the performance of your highways staff in advising EDDC.In particular there is no further 'commercial confidentiality' or predjudice to ongoing negotiations, since these have effectively ceased owing principally to local hostility and widespread recognition of the traffic/highways problems and dangers that use of the proposed venue would have caused. These were obvious to many folk festival attendees even if they were not to either your staff or the festival organisers. There was some considerable open discussion on the internet of course.I have discussed the site and its problems with the National Trust who are the owners of the land.

IR1960864,15/10/2014,Social Care Commissioning,Low,Jenny Goodall,Childrens act services,"Dear Sir or Madam,I apply under the terms of the Freedom of Information legislation for the following information about unaccompanied / separated children migrant children and the changes to civil legal aid that were made by The Legal Aid Sentencing And Punishment of Offenders Act (2012) and which came into effect in April 2013. For the purposes of this FOI request the definition of unaccompanied / separated migrant children includes: ALL migrant children - asylum and non-asylum claimants -who are under the age of 18 years, are outside their country of origin, and have been separated from both parents or from previous legal or customary caregivers. It also includes those children who have not been separated from other caregivers and have been accompanied by other family members.  The questions that follow will sometimes deal separately with those children seeking asylum and those with non-asylum immigration matters. 1.	How many unaccompanied / separated children (under 18 years of age)  have you provided Children Act (1989) Services to between the period of April 2013 and October 2014?  In this question unaccompanied / separated children includes those children that are asylum seekers as well as those that are non-asylum applicants.  2.	How many unaccompanied ASYLUM seeking children (UASC), under the age of 18, have you provided Children Act (1989) Services to between April 2013 and October 2014? 2.3.	How many unaccompanied / separated children, under the age of 18 who are NON-ASYLUM applicants, have you provided Children Act (1989) Services to between April 2013 and October 2014? If you can't provide information for any of the above questions for this time period, please specify for the time you can. In April 2013, cuts to legal aid meant that many unaccompanied and separated migrant children were no longer entitled to legal aid services (by this we mean advice, assistance and representation to address their immigration issues).  These cuts have largely impacted separated and migrant children who DO NOT have an asylum element to their claim. However, they have also impacted children who have  what is known as a mixed case. Children with a mixed case will have an international protection / asylum element to their claim as well as non-asylum / protection basis, such as Article 8 ECHR right to private and family life. In mixed cases, the only part of children's claim that can be progressed on legal aid is the asylum / protection part. 3.4.	How many 'NON-ASYLUM' unaccompanied and separated migrant children that you assist have NOT been entitled to access legal aid for legal advice /assistance and representation to address their immigration issues in the period between April 2013 to October 2014? For this question, as for others below, legal advice and assistance is taken to mean acts such as immigration advice, writing letters, negotiation, getting a barristers opinion, preparing a written case. Legal representation is taken to mean acts such as help preparing an immigration case before a tribunal hearing, as well as representation at a tribunal hearing. 4.5.	How many 'NON-ASYLUM' unaccompanied and separated migrant children that you assist have not been entitled to access legal aid for their immigration issues and have been left without representation and have had to represent themselves between April 2013 and October 2014? Refer to documents for other questions",Some information sent and exceeds appropriate limit,20/10/2014,Complex case,,17/02/2015,Freedom of Information Act,,

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network, typically the Internet.2. E-commerce hosting is a business that furnishes merchants with solutions for selling their merchandise online. The merchant is typically billed monthly for using space on the hosting company's server. Software is also leased for online order processing. E-commerce hosting businesses usually manage all the technical facets of commercial website development and maintenance for their clients. E-commerce hosting can also include electronic data interchange (EDI).3. Exchange Hosting is a service in the telecommunications industry whereby a provider makes a Microsoft e-mail box and space available on a server so its clients can host their data on the server. The provider manages the hosted data of its clients on the server.4. Web Hosting is the activity or business of providing storage space and access for websites.5. VOIP Hosting is a methodology and group of technologies for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet. Other terms commonly associated with VoIP are IP telephony, Internet telephony, voice over broadband (VoBB), broadband telephony, IP communications, and broadband phone service.6.

IR2232764,05/12/2014,Highways Capital Development and Waste Management,Low,Russell Hilton,Priority Schools Building Programme Chagford Primary School,"Under the Freedom of Information Act, I believe I am entitled to see at no charge a certain amount of information based upon the time it takes you to collate the information. Chagford qualified for the government s PSBP in 2011. This scheme I have read offers both new build and large scale refurbishment . Mr Chris Dyer and MR Simon Niles of Devon County Council and Mr Gerard Stone of the EFA amongst others visited our school on 4th November in order to announce Chagford School s acceptance on the PSBP at this meeting he stated that the chances of a refurbishment were vanishingly small . This came as a shock to many and as such I am writing to ask for greater clarification please. The school Specific Brief clearly states that the preferred location for the siting of the school is on its present site. It also states that the sports field should be reinstated on completion of the works along with the preservation of the school amphitheatre, gardens, trees and rocks. By providing the school with a new build, many of these items would be lost or certainly would never be reinstated to the size and condition they are at present. I note that any inconsistencies found between the Generic Design Brief and the School-Specific Brief, result in the School-Specific Brief will take precedence. Therefore the EFA should be considering a large scale refurbishment for Chagford Primary School, especially considering Devon County Council has already invested nearly 400,000 of government money. Would you please put pressure on the EFA to consider a refurbishment, I and many others believe this would be a far better investment than on a poor quality school which probably won t meet the high standards many are expecting and will result in continued and escalating maintenance costs given that the budget for the new build is only 1113/msq. A refurb of 70% of the new build total budget (70% of 2.6) would offer so much more and should be able to include the following: o Energy saving measures such as: the complete replacement of the mechanical and engineering services, this includes all low energy lighting, heating and plumbing. o Better use of natural light and ventilation with double glazing. o The classrooms that overlook the playground may require the following to minimise solar gain, such as solar shading techniques for example, external canopies and deep roof overhangs or shutters. o Internal and/or external cladding as appropriate would need to be undertaken. o Increased insulation of ceilings and floors may be required. o A ground source heat pump but we acknowledge that the present boiler is only 4 years old. o The present school hall of 115sqm this needs to be replaced as it needs to be 170sqm as set out in the Schools Building Bulletin 103. This would mean a new kitchen would also be required. o We understand that a firm Studio OK undertook a survey on behalf of the school in 2003 and drew up a possible plan for the school and its refurbishment with the hall sited near the present entrance. The old hall could be converted for use by the FSU. Please would you release for our information and to gain a better understanding of the construction options, a copy of the Studio OK s plan and associated data. I believe this was drawn up in 2003 and is held in your offices. Please help us and ensure the EFA at the very least involves the community in consultation on the future construction options available to our school. We must consider the environmental impact and the investment to date. With thanks. ",All information sent,08/12/2014,,,16/12/2014,Freedom of Information Act,,

IR2377596,13/01/2015,Highways Capital Development and Waste Management,Low,Jenny Goodall,Schools that request permission to install solar panels,"There are two main scenarios whereby a school may need to know the councils policy and obtain their permission to proceed. In order to ease the information gathering process, I have outlined these:1.	A school wishes to pay for the installation of its own solar panels. Before making such a huge financial commitment, the school would need to know the councils policy (as the owners of the building) in allowing the usage of their roof for the next 20 years. 2.	A school wishes to accept an offer from a third party to install the panels totally free of charge. The arrangement would be on the basis that the third party will be providing, installing, maintaining and insuring the panels for 20 years and in return will receive the feed in tariffs. The school benefit by reducing its carbon footprint, reducing its energy bills and providing an educational resource for its pupils. If a school wished a third party to proceed with an installation of this type, both the school and the third party would need to know whether the council (as the building owners) would allow the usage/lease of their roof for 20 years.Therefore, on the assumption that all regulated criteria such as structural suitability and planning regulations etc could be met satisfactorily by the school and/or third party, and that all reasonable requirements/conditions set by the council will be met, could you please let me know the following:Q1) What information do you have to guide schools on how the council would intend to support or object to scenarios A & B (Whether historic documents, ones yet to be issued to schools or ones discussed for circulation but never issued).Q2) What documentation do you have to show how you may have supported or objected to any schools that have already attempted to install panels in scenarios similar to A & B. For instance, if you have allowed a school to proceed with an installation, a copy of an agreement detailing the conditions required in order to allow the school (and/or third party) to utilise the roof for 20 years will be the information I am requesting. Alternatively, if you have refused a request, a copy of the reasons given for the refusal will be required.Q3) Records of any internal meetings/discussions etc whereby policy/opinions regarding scenarios similar to points A & B have been discussed in general and the notes/documents created as a result of those discussions.Q4) If none of the above situations has occurred, then what is the councils general current policy on scenarios similar to points A & B.Q4) Who within the council has ultimate responsibility for enabling or preventing a school proceeding with scenario A or B and what are their guidelines for decision making.Finally, what plans do the council have/may have had, to install their own solar panels on to their schools estate (and any other building they may own) and what is the current status of these plans.",Some information sent but not all held,15/01/2015,,,10/02/2015,Freedom of Information Act,,
